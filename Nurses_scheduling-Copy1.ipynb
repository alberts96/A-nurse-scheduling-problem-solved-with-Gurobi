    "A large hospital has to cover a set of day-care activities with the available nurses.Each nurse can perform different subsets of the activities, which are implicitly definedby time and skill constraints.  In particular, for each activity the starting time andthe ending time are given, so it is known whether or not it is possible for the samenurse to perform both in sequence (it is assumed that it takes a short enough timeto move across the hospital so that this can be ignored).  Furthermore, nurses can beof three skill levels (beginner, intermediate, advanced), and each activity is markedwith the required skill level:  only nurses with the required skill, or one above, canperform it.  Union regulations dictate the maximum working time (sum of the timeshe’s performing activities) for each nurse; furthermore, nurses can’t be left waitingfor more that a given period (say, two hours) between subsequent activities.  Giventhe available number of nurses with each skill level, the problem is to assign a feasibleset of duties to the smallest possible number of nurses in order to have each activityperformed by exactly one of them.  Among solutions with the same number of nurses,these where less nurses perform activities requiring a skill level below their own arepreferred; the more the skill level is below, the more this should be avoided (but notat the cost of using more than the minimum number of nurses).\n",
